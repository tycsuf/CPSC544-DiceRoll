Dice Roll is a simple dice roll app that exercises a simple game algorithm. The algorithm is described as follows:

The user selects a number from 1 to 6.  When the user taps on Roll!, a die is rolled and the value of the die is added to the user's selected value, giving the user's sum total.
Two additional dice are then rolled for the CPU player and their values are added together, giving the CPU's sum total.

Then modulo 6 is applied to both sum totals, and the resulting values are compared.   The player with the higher, post-modulo value is the winner!

Player scores are tracked in a scoreboard detailing the win/loss/draw counts for each player.

If the player is frustrated or angry with the game results, he/she can tap the Quit button which will force the game to close!

Final note: As a reward for completing the game, this player is presented with a pleasant (or not so pleasant) surprise!
